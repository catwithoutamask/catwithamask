            <h2>The Halloween Saga</h2>
            <h3 class="date">July 11, 2024</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                It all started back in 2017, when we were all stupid teenagers on the internet. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A few days before Halloween there was this little trend going around on Instagram. Basically it was just a prompt going around from story to story. Honestly, I don't really remember the prompt but it was saying something along the lines of:
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <i>"Google for your so and so and add 'Halloween costume'. That will be your costume this year."</i>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                So of course I did it, and the first result was some sort of candy. And because I was not planning on making an actual Halloween costume that year, I thought it would be funny to dress my characters up for Halloween. And with Clisty and Bryan being my only two characters back then, they became my "test subjects". So Clisty was the "lucky" one who got the candy as a costume and Bryan just got a standard skeleton costume cuz I was like "that's cool enough for him".
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="image-box">
                <img src="../../assets/blog/HalloweenSaga/Halloween_2017.jpg" alt="Halloween 2017" class="blog-image">
                <span class="caption">Halloween 2017</span>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                And just like this a little tradition was born :D
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The next year, in 2019 a similar trend with googling "your Halloween costume" was going around. This time the first result was some type of dress and since Clisty had her turn the year prior I decided that Bryan was getting the dress. (Also I wouldn't miss the chance of <a href="./blog/2024-07-14_Dress.html">putting him in a dress :)</a> But that's a story for a different day...)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                So with Bryan being the one getting the dress, I decided to give Clisty my own Halloween costume for that year (I had made a makeshift costume for <i></i><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=Error+sans&iax=images&ia=images" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Error!Sans</a></i>).
            </p>

            <div class="image-box">
                <img src="../../assets/blog/HalloweenSaga/Halloween_2018.jpg" alt="Halloween 2018" class="blog-image">
                <span class="caption">Halloween 2018</span>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                In 2019 I didn't really notice the trend going around again, but still I wanted to continue the Halloween Saga. So I came up with fitting costumes. Clisty, being an actual witch, got to dress up as a classic Halloween witch. And Bryan, he got a cat onesie, "because he is a cat" (him being a cat originated from a time I drew them as cats). That year, I went all out and made a comic where it lead to Clisty actually turning Bryan into a cat. I won't include the comic here, but you can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4RDMr7i--T/?igsh=MTZzODRpeDZxcWVzcQ==" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">check it out on Instagram</a>.

            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
                Lastly in 2020 they got a bit more fitting costumes. I wanted to give a homage to my first inspiration for Bryan as well as having them complementary costumes. So obviously Bryan got to dress as purple guy from FNAF and fitting to that Clisty got to dress as one of the ghosts. Those who know a bit more about my stories will understand why she got to dress as one of the ghosts.

                Unfortunately that was the end of the Halloween Saga (for now). On the fifth year (2021) I did start a drawing but was not happy how it was turning out, so it will just never see the light of day :)
                <br>
                I haven't had the time to draw a Halloween drawing since, but maybe... 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                ...just maybe...
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I might get back to it. We will have to see.
